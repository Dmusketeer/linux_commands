## Linux Architecture

The Linux OS has primarily three components:

<b>Kernel</b>: On the core is the Linux kernel that mediates access to the underlying hardware resources such as the CPU via the scheduler, memory, and peripherals.

<b>Shell</b>: Shell (Ex: Bash, cShell, etc.) provides user access to the kernel, command interpretation and the means to load user applications and execute them.

<b>Applications</b>: Applications make up the bulk of the GNU/Linux operating system. These applications provide useful functions for the OS, such as web browsers, windowing systems, language interpreters, email programs, and programming and development tools.

LINUX has two levels of securities:

- System-level Security: Controlled/Maintained by the system administrator.

- File-level Security: Controlled/Maintained by the owner of the file.


## Linux Bash

Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a Unix shell and a command language interpreter(CLI). A shell is an interface and command line interpreter that executes commands.
